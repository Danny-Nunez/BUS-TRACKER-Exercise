## Description
This bus tracker shows all the stops between MIT and Harvard in Boston, Massachusetts. By clicking on the 'show stops' button in the top left corner, the website will cycle through all the stops by highlighting whichever is in focus. This projectâ€™s focus was to grab the locations of the bus stops asynchronously and to place them on an open-source map.

## How to run
Download all of the files to the same directory, making sure to keep the same file structure in place. Load the index.html file in a browser to start the program. Then just click the button in the top left to start cycling through the stops.

## Future Improvements
Future improvements could include tracing these busses in real time and adding more routes to the map.

## License Info
Code written by Danny Nunez using starter code from the MITxPRO full stack development bootcamp course.
